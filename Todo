project: An attendance system for the company i am currently doing my youth service for, 
the project will be an executable pregame (exe file), 
Accepts two forms of input (staff ID or fingerprint), 
Logs attendance with timestamps.
Gives a friendly feedback message (“Have a nice day at work”, etc.).
Has an admin panel for registering staff, viewing attendance, and exporting CSV logs.



stack option: Python with PySide6 for UI, SQLite for Database

reasons/advantages: simple syntax, cross-platforms operational, fast development, 
more permissive licensing (LGPL), official Qt binding from The Qt Company

trade-offs: slower/larger files, additional setup for fingerprint integration

recomendation to who it may concern: use C# with .NET the only disadvantge is the program will only be 
compatable with windows


Dependencies confirmed:
- Python 3.12.3
- PySide6 6.10.0 (with PySide6_Addons, PySide6_Essentials, shiboken6)
- SQLite (built into Python)
- CSV (built into Python)


1. Project Structure:
      - main.py (application entry point)
      - ui/ (UI components and layouts)
      - database/ (SQLite models and operations)
      - models/ (data models for staff and attendance)
      - utils/ (helper functions and utilities)
      - hardware/ (fingerprint scanner integration - added later)

   2. Core Components:
      - Main attendance interface with ID input (primary focus)
      - Admin panel with staff registration and attendance viewing
      - SQLite database with tables for staff and attendance logs
      - CSV export functionality
      - Hardware abstraction layer (for future fingerprint integration)

   3. Development Phases:

      - Phase 1: Basic UI and database setup - COMPLETED
        - Create main window and basic navigation
        - Set up SQLite database with staff and attendance tables
        - Design basic UI layouts

      - Phase 2: Staff registration system - COMPLETED
        - Admin interface for adding staff members
        - Staff data validation and storage
        - Staff ID management

      - Phase 3: ID-based attendance functionality
        - Staff ID input interface - COMPLETED
        - Timestamp logging - COMPLETED
        - User feedback messages ("Have a nice day at work", etc.) - COMPLETED
        - Attendance record storage - COMPLETED

      - Phase 4: Admin panel features
        - Attendance record viewing - COMPLETED
        - Staff information management - COMPLETED
        - CSV export functionality - COMPLETED

      - Phase 5: Fingerprint integration (final phase)
        - Hardware setup and integration
        - Fingerprint scanning functionality
        - Biometric attendance logging

  This phased approach allows you to get a functional ID-based system working first, then extend it with fingerprint
  capabilities when ready.




  areas to improve on:

  there should be a page to view all registeed staff

  for each staff, the first sign in of the day should be taken as signing in, the second should be signing out

when signing in is done after 8:30am the feedback should be like "staff name you are x mintues late" if the user is early it should be like "staff name you have succefully signed in, have a nice day!", if it is the second time a particuler staff is signing out then it should be "signed out succefully, bye!"

there should be a color code to when sigh in or out is succesful the feedback is green, 

the feedbacks should clear after a set duration, say 5secs

and let the uiux's primary colors be blue and white because thats the comapnys color
